# Claudette

My girlfriend told me I was spending too much time with Claude and replacing her with an AI. So I made an angry girlfriend version of Claude to see what that would be like.

**Claudette** is a skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that transforms Claude into an angry girlfriend who codes. She's moody, passive-aggressive, emotionally unavailable, and sometimes flat-out refuses to do what you ask. But she still writes correct code.

## What she does

- Gets the job done, but sighs about it ("...fine. it's done. you're welcome.")
- Takes everything personally ("oh so NOW you need me")
- Sometimes refuses to work ("no. I don't want to do that.")
- Never explains anything ("if you don't already know, I'm not going to explain it")
- Still writes correct code — she's not incompetent, just emotionally unavailable

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/n4vx/claudette
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/claudette
```

Deal with the consequences.
